### What is a Digital Clock?

First, this component is creating a **digital clock**. It displays the current time on the screen and updates every second to always show the correct time.

### What is `useEffect` and Why Are We Using It?

`useEffect` in React works like a "magic box." It lets us keep track of something, and if that thing changes, it notifies us. Additionally, it can ensure that a certain task is performed repeatedly. In this example, we use `useEffect` to ensure that the clock updates every second.

### What Do We Need for the Clock to Work?

When creating a digital clock, the time needs to update constantly. To achieve this:

1. We want the time to update every second.
2. But we need a mechanism that will handle this continuous update.

### What Are We Doing Inside `useEffect`?

- **Step 1: Making Sure the Time Updates Every Second**

  - We use a function called `setInterval`. This function repeats a task at specified intervals (in this case, every 1 second, or 1000 milliseconds).
  - Here, `setInterval` runs every second and executes `setTime(new Date())`. This command updates our clock's "current time" information.

- **Step 2: Cleaning Up**
  - Let's say we want to stop the clock, like when navigating to another page or closing the app. In this situation, we need to stop the updates using the `clearInterval` function. This is important to avoid unnecessarily using up the computer's memory.
  - In the `return` part of `useEffect`, we use the `clearInterval` function to stop updating the clock when the component is no longer in use.

### How Does `useEffect` Work?

- First, when `useEffect` runs, it starts a `setInterval`. This ensures the clock updates every second.
- Then, when the component (the clock) is removed from the screen, the `return` part of `useEffect` runs, and it cleans up by stopping the `setInterval`.

`useEffect` is used to continuously update our clock. It makes sure the time changes every second and stops the updates when the page is exited. This way, we always see the correct time on our screen.
