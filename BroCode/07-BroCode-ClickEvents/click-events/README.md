# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



How I created this react project:

npm create vite@latest

then i gave a name to the project for example: is card-components

cd card-components

npm install

npm run dev


When you want to open the project, you should be in the directory of the project such as card-components or click-events. So you might be using the terminal with "cd" command for sometime before hitting the npm run dev command.

If running the project doesn't redirect you to the web, for this project the url is:

localhost:5173

Cheers!
